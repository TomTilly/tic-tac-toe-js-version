# Tic-Tac-Toe in JavaScript

A fluid Tic-Tac-Toe game made with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery.

Fluid Layout
------

The game was designed fluidly, so that the content can be resized and adjust to any window size. Viewport percentages(vh, vw, vmin, vmax), a fairly new method at the time of writing, were used for various size measurements. Please note that these units are only supported by relatively current versions of browsers.
